            <p id="message1" class="message">I owe you an apology, so here it goes........ <b>
                We’ve been together for six months, and today, on what should have been our anniversary, I find myself reflecting on our time together, mostly because of all the memories we shared that i had to see today while compiling that album.
                 we broke up two days ago, and I want to take a moment to apologize for everything I put you through, the trust breach,the times my action made you feel bad
                 or feel less than you are,  among other things. I'm really sorry Favour.

Our different backgrounds and beliefs, among other challenges, were factors that contributed to the decision I made, a part of it was trust and that wasn't on you because you've shown me to an extent how trustworthy you can be so i guess that was my problem. I realize now that I didn’t handle these differences as well as I should have. I’m truly sorry for the hurt and confusion my actions caused you.
I regret the way things ended and the pain that it brought you and i ended things because i didnt want these reasons to cause more pain for the both of us later in life when we're all figured out. You deserved better from me, and I wish I had been more understanding and considerate throughout our relationship.
Please know that despite how things turned out, I genuinely value the time we spent together , the passionate love we had for each other and the moments we shared. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and I sincerely wish you all the happiness and peace moving forward.

            </b></p>
            <p id="message2" class="message">Even though today is our anniversary and things didn’t turn out the way either of us hoped, I want to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for you.
                You brought so much light and warmth into my life. Your kindness, your smile, and the moments we shared will always hold a special place in my heart , Despite the challenges we faced I cherish the time we spent together and the memories we created.
                We both weren't perfect, we had issues of our own but i don't think if we hadn't met we wouldn't have made as much progress individually as we did in such little time so thank you.
                I also can say you are one of the best things to happen to me in my entire life and i dont think i would ever stop caring about you.
            </p>
            <p id="message3" class="message">As we've reached this point, I want to take a moment to reflect on the positive aspects of our time together and to share my hopes for your future.

                Our relationship, though it had its challenges, was filled with moments of joy and connection that I will always treasure. From the laughter we shared to the support we gave each other, there were many meaningful experiences that I look back on smiling.
                
                I truly believe that every experience, even the difficult ones, has helped us grow and learn more about ourselves and what we need. I am grateful for the lessons we learned together and for the personal growth that came from our time as a couple.
                
                As we move forward, my hope for you is that you continue to find happiness and success in all that you do. I wish for you to pursue your passions like we talked about, embrace new opportunities, and surround yourself with people who appreciate and value you for who you are. You have so much to offer, and I have no doubt that you will achieve great things and find the happiness you deserve.
                
                Thank you for being a part of my life and for the moments we shared. I hope that, in time, we can both look back on our relationship with a sense of gratitude and peace.</p>
